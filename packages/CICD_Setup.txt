Now you have a complete automated CI/CD setup with:
1. Automatic Version Bumping when PRs are merged to main/master
- Uses the PR title to determine bump type (patch, minor, major)
- Follows Conventional Commits format
2. Automatic Publishing to npm
- Publishes when new versions are pushed to main/master
- Creates GitHub releases automatically
- Only publishes if the version doesn't already exist
3. Documentation Generation and Publishing
- Generates API documentation using TypeDoc
- Publishes to GitHub Pages automatically
- Documentation is accessible via GitHub Pages URL
To get this working:
1. Add NPM Token to GitHub Secrets:
- Generate an npm token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/[your-username]/tokens
- Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Add a new repository secret called NPM_TOKEN with your npm token
2. Enable GitHub Pages:
- After the first docs workflow runs, go to GitHub repository → Settings → Pages
- Set the source to "Deploy from a branch" and select "gh-pages" branch
3. Add Documentation with TypeDoc Comments:
- Add JSDoc comments to your components to improve documentation
- Example:

Your package is now fully set up for automated publishing and documentation generation!
